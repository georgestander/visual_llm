# MVP 1: Basic Idea Generation

Implement a simple user interface with a text input for user prompts and a text output for generated ideas.
Integrate a basic LLM (e.g., GPT-3) to generate ideas based on user prompts.  
Display generated ideas as plain text without any visualization.

## MVP 2: Idea Tree Visualization

Enhance the user interface to include a basic idea tree visualization.
Represent each generated idea as a node in the tree, with the initial prompt as the root node.  
Implement basic tree navigation features, such as expanding and collapsing nodes.

## MVP 3: Knowledge Graph Integration

Introduce a basic knowledge graph alongside the idea tree visualization.
Establish simple relationships between ideas based on their similarity or semantic connections.
Display the knowledge graph as a separate visualization, allowing users to explore idea connections.

## MVP 4: Context Management

Implement basic context management techniques to maintain coherence within a single branch.
Use a fixed context window to consider the most recent ideas when generating new ones.  
Allow users to navigate through the idea tree while maintaining the current context.

## MVP 5: Collaboration and Sharing

Add basic collaboration features, allowing multiple users to view and contribute to the same brainstorming session.
Implement real-time synchronization of the idea tree and knowledge graph across user devices.
Provide simple sharing options, such as generating a shareable link for the brainstorming session.

## MVP 6: Idea Voting and Commenting

Introduce voting and commenting functionality for users to provide feedback on ideas.
Allow users to upvote or downvote ideas and leave comments on specific nodes in the idea tree.
Display the total number of votes and comments for each idea.

## MVP 7: Session Persistence

Implement basic session persistence, allowing users to save and resume brainstorming sessions.
Store the idea tree, knowledge graph, and user interactions in a database.
Provide options to create new sessions, save current sessions, and load previously saved sessions.

## MVP 8: Idea Exporting

Add the ability to export the brainstorming session results.
Allow users to export the idea tree and knowledge graph in various formats (e.g., text, JSON, CSV).
Provide options to customize the exported data, such as selecting specific branches or filtering ideas based on criteria.

As the project progresses, each MVP can be further enhanced and refined based on user feedback and evolving requirements. Additional features and improvements can be incorporated iteratively, such as:

- Advanced context management techniques, including branch-specific context and asynchronous retrieval.
- More sophisticated idea generation using fine-tuned LLMs or domain-specific models.
- Enhanced visualization and interaction capabilities for the idea tree and knowledge graph.
- Improved collaboration features, such as real-time editing, user roles, and permissions.
- Integration with external knowledge bases or APIs to enrich the brainstorming experience.
- Customizable templates and prompts for different brainstorming scenarios.
- Analytics and insights to track user engagement and identify popular ideas.
