# Visual LLM

## Objective
Develop an interactive brainstorming assistant that utilizes an LLM to generate ideas and enables users to explore and navigate through a divergent idea tree and knowledge graph. The assistant should provide a visually intuitive interface, maintain context efficiently, and support seamless branching and hopping between ideas.

## Scope
1. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a web-based user interface for the brainstorming assistant.
   - Implement a chat-like interface for user input and LLM responses.
   - Display the idea tree and knowledge graph visualizations alongside the chat interface.
   - Enable interactive features like node selection, branching, and hopping.

2. **Idea Generation**:
   - Integrate an LLM (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) for generating ideas based on user prompts.
   - Implement prompt engineering techniques to guide the LLM towards relevant and creative ideas.
   - Allow users to provide feedback and refine the generated ideas.

3. **Idea Tree Visualization**:
   - Create a dynamic and interactive idea tree visualization.
   - Represent each idea as a node in the tree, with the initial prompt as the base node.
   - Enable users to expand, collapse, and navigate through the idea tree.
   - Implement visual cues to indicate the current branch and context.

4. **Knowledge Graph Integration**:
   - Construct a knowledge graph based on the ideas and their relationships.
   - Represent ideas as nodes and their connections as edges in the graph.
   - Update the knowledge graph in real-time as new ideas are generated and explored.
   - Utilize the knowledge graph to identify related ideas and suggest potential branches.

5. **Context Management**:
   - Implement efficient context management techniques to maintain coherence across branches.
   - Utilize a sliding context window, branch-specific context, and hierarchical context.
   - Employ embeddings and similarity measures to retrieve relevant context when hopping between branches.
   - Implement context compression and asynchronous retrieval for large and divergent trees.

6. **Collaboration and Sharing**:
   - Allow multiple users to collaborate on the same brainstorming session.
   - Implement real-time synchronization of the idea tree and knowledge graph across user devices.
   - Provide features for users to comment, vote, and build upon each other's ideas.
   - Enable sharing and exporting of the brainstorming session results.

7. **Performance and Scalability**:
   - Optimize the system's performance to handle large and complex idea trees.
   - Implement caching mechanisms and indexing techniques to improve response times.
   - Ensure scalability to support multiple concurrent users and brainstorming sessions.
   - Monitor and address any performance bottlenecks or resource constraints.

8. **Data Persistence**:
   - Implement a database system to store and retrieve brainstorming session data.
   - Persist the idea tree, knowledge graph, and conversation history.
   - Enable users to save, load, and resume brainstorming sessions.

9. **Security and Privacy**:
   - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Ensure secure communication between the client and server components.
   - Protect user data and comply with relevant privacy regulations.

10. **Documentation and User Guide**:
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the brainstorming assistant.
    - Provide user guides and tutorials to help users navigate and utilize the features effectively.
    - Include examples and best practices for effective brainstorming sessions.
