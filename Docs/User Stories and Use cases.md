# User Stories and Use Cases: Visual LLM

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Idea Generation
As a user, I want to input a prompt or topic and receive creative and relevant ideas generated by the LLM, so that I can explore various possibilities and perspectives related to my brainstorming session.

### User Story 2: Idea Tree Visualization
As a user, I want to see a visual representation of the generated ideas in the form of an idea tree, so that I can easily understand the relationships and hierarchy between different ideas.

### User Story 3: Idea Tree Navigation
As a user, I want to be able to expand, collapse, and navigate through the nodes of the idea tree, so that I can focus on specific branches or ideas of interest.

### User Story 4: Knowledge Graph Integration
As a user, I want to see a knowledge graph that displays the connections and relationships between different ideas, so that I can discover new insights and associations.

### User Story 5: Context Management
As a user, I want the system to maintain context as I navigate through different branches of the idea tree, so that the generated ideas remain coherent and relevant to the current focus.

### User Story 6: Collaboration
As a user, I want to collaborate with other users in real-time during a brainstorming session, so that we can contribute ideas, provide feedback, and build upon each other's thoughts.

### User Story 7: Idea Voting and Commenting
As a user, I want to be able to vote on ideas and leave comments, so that I can provide feedback and prioritize the most promising or interesting ideas.

### User Story 8: Session Persistence
As a user, I want to be able to save my brainstorming session and resume it later, so that I can continue my exploration and ideation process across multiple sessions.

### User Story 9: Idea Exporting
As a user, I want to export the generated ideas and the idea tree structure, so that I can share them with others or use them in other applications or documents.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Generate Ideas
1. User enters a prompt or topic into the brainstorming interface.
2. System sends the prompt to the LLM for idea generation.
3. LLM generates a set of ideas based on the prompt.
4. System displays the generated ideas to the user.

### Use Case 2: Visualize Idea Tree
1. User triggers the idea tree visualization.
2. System retrieves the generated ideas and their relationships.
3. System constructs the idea tree structure.
4. System renders the idea tree visualization in the user interface.

### Use Case 3: Navigate Idea Tree
1. User interacts with the idea tree visualization (expand, collapse, select nodes).
2. System updates the idea tree visualization based on user interactions.
3. System retrieves and displays the relevant ideas and context for the selected node.

### Use Case 4: View Knowledge Graph
1. User triggers the knowledge graph visualization.
2. System retrieves the ideas and their relationships from the knowledge graph database.
3. System renders the knowledge graph visualization in the user interface.

### Use Case 5: Collaborate in Real-Time
1. Multiple users join a brainstorming session.
2. Users contribute ideas and interact with the idea tree and knowledge graph.
3. System synchronizes the changes and updates across all user devices in real-time.

### Use Case 6: Vote and Comment on Ideas
1. User selects an idea in the idea tree or knowledge graph.
2. User submits a vote (e.g., upvote, downvote) or leaves a comment on the idea.
3. System records the vote and comment and updates the idea's metadata.

### Use Case 7: Save and Resume Session
1. User triggers the save session functionality.
2. System captures the current state of the idea tree, knowledge graph, and user interactions.
3. System stores the session data in a persistent storage.
4. User can later resume the session by loading the saved data.

### Use Case 8: Export Ideas
1. User triggers the export functionality.
2. System generates a structured representation of the ideas and idea tree (e.g., JSON, XML).
3. System provides the exported data to the user for downloading or sharing.

These user stories and use cases provide a high-level overview of the key functionalities and interactions in the Visual LLM application. They help in understanding the user requirements and guide the
