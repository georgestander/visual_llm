# System Architecture: Visual LLM

## Overview

The Visual LLM system follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend application communicates with the backend server to generate ideas, manage the idea tree and knowledge graph, and facilitate collaboration among users. The system leverages various technologies and components to deliver an interactive and visually appealing brainstorming experience.

### Components ###
- **Frontend (Svelte)**: The frontend is built using the Svelte framework, which provides a reactive and efficient way to build user interfaces. It consists of components for user input, idea tree visualization, knowledge graph visualization, and collaboration features. The frontend communicates with the backend server through API requests to retrieve and update data.

- **Backend (Flask)**: The backend is developed using the Flask web framework in Python. It handles API requests from the frontend, processes data, and communicates with various external services and databases. The backend integrates with the Google LLM to generate ideas based on user prompts. It also interacts with the Neo4j database to store and retrieve data related to the idea tree and knowledge graph.

- **Google LLM**: The system integrates with Google's Large Language Model (LLM) to generate creative and relevant ideas based on user prompts. The backend sends prompts to the LLM and receives generated ideas in response. The LLM is fine-tuned and optimized for the brainstorming use case to provide high-quality and coherent ideas.

- **Google Embedding Models**: Google's embedding models are used to generate vector representations of ideas. These embeddings help in measuring the similarity between ideas and facilitating context management. The backend utilizes the embedding models to retrieve relevant ideas and maintain coherence as users navigate through the idea tree.

- **Neo4j Database**: Neo4j, a graph database, is used to store and manage the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph represents the relationships and connections between ideas. The backend interacts with the Neo4j database to store ideas as nodes and their relationships as edges. Querying the knowledge graph enables the discovery of related ideas and provides insights for brainstorming.

- **Google Cloud Storage**: Google Cloud Storage is used for persistent storage of brainstorming session data. The backend saves the state of the idea tree, knowledge graph, and user interactions in Cloud Storage. This allows users to resume their brainstorming sessions across multiple devices and ensures data durability.

- **Google Cloud Identity**: Google Cloud Identity is used for user authentication and authorization. Users can log in to the Visual LLM application using their Google credentials. The backend integrates with Google Cloud Identity to secure user data and ensure proper access control.

**Data Flow**

- User interacts with the frontend application, entering prompts and triggering actions.

- The frontend sends API requests to the backend server.

- The backend processes the requests and communicates with the Google LLM to generate ideas.

- The generated ideas are stored in the Neo4j database as part of the knowledge graph.

- The backend retrieves relevant ideas and context from the Neo4j database and Google Cloud Storage.

- The retrieved data is sent back to the frontend for visualization and user interaction.

- User actions, such as voting and commenting on ideas, are sent to the backend for processing and storage.

- The backend updates the Neo4j database and Google Cloud Storage based on user actions.

- Real-time collaboration is achieved through WebSocket communication between the frontend and backend.

**Scalability and Performance**

- The system is designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and extensive idea trees.

- The backend leverages caching mechanisms and optimized database queries to improve performance.

- Google Cloud's scalability features, such as auto-scaling and load balancing, are utilized to handle increased traffic and ensure responsiveness.

- The frontend implements lazy loading and pagination techniques to efficiently render large idea trees and knowledge graphs.

**Security and Privacy**

- User authentication and authorization are handled using Google Cloud Identity.

- All user data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

- Access control policies restrict data access to authorized users only.

- Data isolation and compartmentalization provide separation between users and organizations.
