# Project Charter: Visual LLM

## Project Overview
The Visual LLM project aims to develop an interactive brainstorming assistant that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate ideas and enables users to explore and navigate through a divergent idea tree and knowledge graph. The assistant will provide a visually intuitive interface, maintain context efficiently, and support seamless branching and hopping between ideas.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a web-based application with a responsive user interface for the brainstorming assistant.
2. Integrate a suitable LLM for generating creative and relevant ideas based on user prompts.
3. Implement real-time visualization of the idea tree and knowledge graph to enhance user understanding and navigation.
4. Develop efficient context management techniques to maintain coherence across branches and support seamless exploration.
5. Enable collaboration features for multiple users to participate in brainstorming sessions simultaneously.
6. Ensure scalability and performance to handle large idea trees and concurrent users.
7. Implement data persistence and retrieval mechanisms for saving and loading brainstorming sessions.
8. Provide comprehensive documentation and user guides for ease of use and adoption.

## Project Scope
The Visual LLM project will include the following key features and functionalities:
- Web-based user interface for user input and LLM response display
- Integration with a suitable LLM (e.g., Google's BERT, T5) for idea generation
- Real-time visualization of the idea tree and knowledge graph using D3.js
- Efficient context management techniques for maintaining coherence across branches
- Collaboration features for multiple users to participate in brainstorming sessions
- Scalable architecture to handle large idea trees and concurrent users
- Data persistence and retrieval mechanisms using Neo4j graph database
- Secure authentication, authorization, and data protection measures
- Comprehensive documentation and user guides

## Deliverables
1. Visual LLM web application with the specified features and functionalities
2. Source code and documentation hosted on a version control platform (e.g., GitHub)
3. User manual and onboarding guide for end-users
4. Technical documentation for developers and maintainers
5. Deployment instructions and configuration files for production environment

## Success Criteria
1. User Acceptance: The Visual LLM application should receive positive feedback from end-users regarding its usability, effectiveness, and value in brainstorming sessions.
2. Performance: The application should handle large idea trees and multiple concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
3. Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing user demand and data growth.
4. Collaboration: The collaboration features should enable seamless and real-time interaction among users during brainstorming sessions.
5. Documentation: The project documentation should be comprehensive, up-to-date, and easily accessible for users and developers.

## Constraints and Assumptions
- The project will be developed using the specified tech stack (Python, Flask, Svelte, Google Cloud Platform, Neo4j).
- The availability and performance of the chosen LLM and embedding models from Google will impact the project's success.
- The project timeline and resources are based on the assumption of a dedicated development team with the required skills and expertise.
- The project scope may need to be adjusted based on the available budget and time constraints.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
1. LLM Performance: The chosen LLM may not generate satisfactory ideas or maintain coherence across branches.
   - Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and evaluation of different LLMs and fine-tune them specifically for the brainstorming use case.

2. Scalability Challenges: The system may face performance issues when handling a large number of concurrent users and extensive idea trees.
   - Mitigation: Implement caching mechanisms, optimize database queries, and leverage Google Cloud's scalability features to handle increased load.

3. User Adoption: Users may find the interface complex or have difficulty navigating the idea
